This repo is useless, was some kind of practice i were doing. Here is the rundown. If you care.
This repo was created inspired by the game Hacknet. It's a good opportunity to practice coding and using Github.

It's a simulation, a game to be exact. Where you'll do alot of *hecking* to get admin access. 
And also the project is unfinish.

*As you can see, most of them are written in Ruby. I think it'd be more ideal if they were compiled to machine code, which is something i were trying to do, after finish this ofcourse.*

### The Hecknet Replicate ###
*It's not 'Replicate' though, my thesaurus is poor so let's go with it. Sorry.*

## core.rb ##
This file contains simple Unix-style commands that let you move around, doing inspection with computer file system.
The only different is, you must put command opt inside quote marks and inside a pair parenthesis. (Because Ruby, I am sorry)
```ruby
cd("./rab/oof") ```

## secure.rb ##
*Was trying to create some pseudo-hacking puzzle-solving console-based game, but have yet to finish any.*

# login() #
Perform login, start the challenge.
-----
*Password-solving purpose script*
## guess.rb ##
This script helps you guess the password. Based on Fallout 4 Hacking minigame. ~~pls dont copyright this~~

## breech.rb ##
Tools helps for solving the password. You can either use this, or don't use it at all.
And ofcourse, they are all game. Non of them have practical use for the society, just like their master.

## dic.txt ##
This file is a compilation from this [site](http://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-1000-words/)
Props to them.

That should be it.
