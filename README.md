*Password-solving purpose script*
## guess.rb ##
This script helps you guess the password. Based on Fallout 4 Hacking minigame. ~~pls dont copyright this~~
You have a number of tries to guess the password. After every wrong guess, you'll received a number called 'LIKELINESS'. It means, the word you've guessed have 'LIKELINESS' characters that are in the same position as in the password.


There are currently two type of tools you can use:

### assist.rb ###
These tools in here that will give you some clue to solving the password.
Doesn't cost any 'TRIES'.

### breech.rb ###
Tools here will help you solve some characters in the password. Unfortunately even the one you've already known.
Mostly costs 'TRIES', some may costs more than 1, some doesn't cost any at all.
