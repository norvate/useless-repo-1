This repo is useless, was some kind of practice i were doing. Here is the rundown. If you care.
This repo was created inspired by the game Hacknet. It's a good opportunity to practice coding and using Github.

It's a simulation, a game to be exact. Where you'll need to get admin access.
The project is unfinish.

*As you can see, most of them are written in Ruby. I think it'd be more ideal if they were compiled to machine code.*

# TOs #
  *TOs is a myth Operating System. There are rumors about this one around corners of the internet.*
  *TOs was original from a small devs team, way back in the 90's. Purpose was mostly of personal uses.
  But later people found there was traces of an organization.*
  
  *You're just an ordinary PC user, then one day, there was a terminal start up right after every boot.*

## core.rb ##
This file contains simple Unix-style commands that let you move around, doing inspection with computer file system.

## secure.rb ##
*Was trying to create some pseudo-hacking puzzle-solving console-based game, but have yet to finish any.*
Protection layer.

*Password-solving purpose script*
## guess.rb ##
This script helps you guess the password. Based on Fallout 4 Hacking minigame. ~~pls dont copyright this~~
You have a number of tries to guess the password. After every wrong guess, you'll received a number called 'LIKELINESS'. It means, the word you guessed have a 'LIKELINESS' number of characters that are in the same position in the password.
There are currently two kind of tools you can use:

### assist.rb ###
These tools in here that will give you some clue to solving the password.
Doesn't cost any 'TRIES'.

### breech.rb ###
Tools here will help you solve some characters in the password. Unfortunately even the one you've already known.
Mostly costs 'TRIES', some may costs more than 1, some doesn't cost any at all.
